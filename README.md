## Overview

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/redjack/varon-t/develop.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/redjack/varon-t)

The Varon-T library is a C implementation of the
[disruptor queue](http://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/), a high performance
messaging library based on an efficient FIFO circular queue implementation.

API documentation can be found [here](http://varon-t.readthedocs.org/).


## Build instructions

To build Varon-T, you need the following libraries installed on your system:

  * pkg-config
  * [libcork](https://github.com/redjack/libcork)
  * [check](http://check.sourceforge.net)
  * [clogger](https://github.com/redjack/clogger)

If you want to build the documentation, you also need:

  * [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/)

If you want to run all of the test cases, you also need:

  * [cram](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cram/)

The Varon-T library uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) as its build manager.
In most cases, you should be able to build the library from source code using
the following commands from the top level of your copy of the source tree:

    $ mkdir .build
    $ cd .build
    $ cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

There are two tests. The first is a functional test and the second is a
performance test. The latter may take a couple of minutes to complete.

You might have to run the last command using sudo, if you need administrative
privileges to write to the `$PREFIX` directory.
